# CS2820 Fall 2021 WARP Project Code
This code base will be used for the University of Iowa CS 2820 Introduction to Software
Development course. The code was developed by Steve Goddard for the WARP sensor network 
research project. It was first written in Swift and rewritten in Java. It was then rewritten again in an object-oriented programming style. It was a quick
hack, and it needs a lot of cleanup and refactoring. A perfect code base to teach
the value of software developement fundamentals!

Student Edit: This is a description to remind you that in order for your output files to be located in the directory OutputFiles you need to include
the -o flag option in the program arguments box, located in the run configurations tab. This is the basic structure for using any flag, but remember 
that certain flags might require arguments.


Student Edit (10/13/21): Generated some UML diagrams for Reliability*.java, WorkLoad.java, and SchedulableObject.java files. I also added a public method, 
with return type ReliabilityTable, to ReliabilityAnalysis.java through its class box diagram.
