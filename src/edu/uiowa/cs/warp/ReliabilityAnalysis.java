/**
 * ReliabilityAnalysis analyzes the end-to-end reliability
 * of messages transmitted in flows for the WARP system. <p>
 *  
 * Let M represent the Minimum Packet Reception Rate on an
 * edge in a flow. The end-to-end reliability for each
 * flow, flow:src->sink, is computed iteratively as follows:<br>
 * (1)The flow:src node has an initial probability of 1.0 when
 * it is released. All other initial probabilities are 0.0. (That
 * is, the reset of the nodes in the flow have an initial probability
 * value of 0.0.) <br>
 * (2) each src->sink pair probability is computed as
 * NewSinkNodeState = (1-M)*PrevSnkNodeState + M*PrevSrcNodeState <br>
 * This value represents the probability that the message as been 
 * received by the node SinkNode.
 * Thus, the NewSinkNodeState probability will increase each time 
 * a push or pull is executed with SinkNode as a listener. <p>
 * 
 * The last probability state value for any node is the reliability of
 * the message reaching that node, and the end-to-end reliability of
 * a flow is the value of the last Flow:SinkNode probability.<p>
 * 
 * CS2820 Fall 2021 Project: Implement this class to compute the
 * probabilities the comprise the ReliablityMatrix, which is the core
 * of the file visualization that is requested in WarpTester.<p>
 * 
 * To do this, you will need to retrieve the program source,
 * parse the instructions for each node, in each time slot,
 * to extract the src and snk nodes in the instruction and then
 * apply the message success probability equation defined above.<p>
 * 
 * I recommend using the getInstructionParameters method of the 
 * WarpDSL class to extract the src and snk nodes from the instruction 
 * string in a program schedule time slot.
