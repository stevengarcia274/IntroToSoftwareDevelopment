Warp tester - driver - accepts .ra returns relability analysis file
project - extend, dont modify
output file (example.txt xls file) - in xl sheet, left is dsl, right is ra 
collumns - programs that the comps in the flow execute, execute in lock step
A executes -> B executes -> C executes
A is coordinator
graphs are 2 dim matrix full of strings, we have to read and find src and sink and coordinator, etc
2 dimensional vector with doubles for entries - reliability table
warp object is of type program
ReliablityVisualization extends VisualizationObject, finish it
ProgramVisualization is a good example
Takes notes of sequence of calls and such, sequence diagram would be good

Start at the end,
understand what the ra file looks like and how read that source code
Start at warptester and work backwards, what are examples of how other files like that are made
Create artifacts that help understand and remember the design


Sequence
WarpTest is ran
setWarpParameters(args) runs (WarpTester -> WarpTester)
WorkLoad object contructed (WarpTester -> WorkLoad) (Actually nescessary to include?)
visualize (Warp warp, SystemChoices choice) runs (WarpTester-> WarpTester)
createProgramVisualistion(warp, outputSubDirectory, choice) runs (WarpTester -> VisualizationFactory)
returns VisualizationImplementation(warp, outputDirectory, choice) (Visualization -> VisualizationImplementation)
fileManager() constructed (VisualizationImplementation -> FileManager ->  VisualizationImplementation)
warp.toWorkLoad().getInputFileName() (VisualizationImplementation -> WorkLoad -> VisualizationImplementation)
fm.getBaseDirectory(),fm.createDirectory(workingDirectory, outputDirectory) (VisualizationImplementation -> FileManager -> VisualizationImplementation)
finishes (VisualizationImplementation -> VisualizationFactory -> WarpTester)
viz.toFile() (WarpTester -> returned file)
